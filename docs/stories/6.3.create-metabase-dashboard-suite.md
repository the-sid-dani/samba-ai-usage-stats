# Story 6.3: Create Metabase Dashboard Suite

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Finance Team Member,
**I want** all 6 dashboard types recreated in Metabase with identical functionality to original Looker specifications,
**so that** I can access the same cost analysis and reporting capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Cost Allocation Workbench created with user/team cost breakdowns and ROI analysis
3. Engineering Productivity Analytics created with acceptance rates and productivity metrics
4. Platform ROI Analysis created with cost-per-productivity calculations
5. System Administration Panel created with data quality monitoring
6. Compliance & Security View created with access auditing capabilities
7. All dashboards support CSV, XLSX, JSON, and PNG export functionality

## Dev Notes

### Dashboard Design Specifications
**Finance Executive Dashboard:**
- **Key Metrics:** Total monthly cost, cost per user, growth rates
- **Visualizations:** Line charts (trends), pie charts (distribution), KPI cards
- **Filters:** Date range, platform, cost threshold
- **Layout:** Executive summary cards with drill-down capability

**Cost Allocation Workbench:**
- **Key Metrics:** User costs, team efficiency, ROI calculations
- **Visualizations:** Tables (detailed breakdowns), bar charts (comparisons)
- **Filters:** User, team, platform, time period, efficiency tier
- **Layout:** Detailed analysis tables with sorting and filtering

**Engineering Productivity Analytics:**
- **Key Metrics:** Acceptance rates, lines of code, user activity
- **Visualizations:** Line charts (trends), scatter plots (correlations)
- **Filters:** User, platform, time period, performance tier
- **Layout:** Productivity tracking with benchmarking

### Metabase Configuration
**Collections Structure:**
```
├── Finance (Finance team access)
│   ├── Executive Dashboard
│   └── Cost Allocation Workbench
├── Engineering (Engineering team access)
│   ├── Productivity Analytics
│   └── Platform ROI Analysis
└── Admin (Admin-only access)
    ├── System Administration Panel
    └── Compliance & Security View
```

**User Groups:**
- **Finance Team:** Read access to Finance collection
- **Engineering Team:** Read access to Engineering collection
- **Administrators:** Full access to all collections

### Export Configuration
**Supported Formats:**
- **CSV:** Raw data export for spreadsheet analysis
- **XLSX:** Formatted Excel export with charts preserved
- **JSON:** API-friendly format for programmatic access
- **PNG:** Dashboard screenshots for presentations

**Automation:**
- **Scheduled Reports:** Monthly finance reports auto-generated
- **Email Distribution:** Automated delivery to stakeholders
- **API Exports:** Programmatic export via Metabase API

## Testing
- All 6 dashboard types must render correctly with real data
- Export functionality must work for all supported formats
- Dashboard performance must meet 5-second query target
- User access controls must restrict data appropriately

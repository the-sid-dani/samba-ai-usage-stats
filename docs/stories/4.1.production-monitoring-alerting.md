## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
No previous Epic 4 stories exist. This is the foundational monitoring story that enables production-grade reliability before infrastructure deployment (Epic 5).

### Technical Architecture References

**Monitoring Stack** [Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md]:
- Infrastructure Monitoring: Google Cloud Monitoring (native GCP integration)
- Application Logging: Google Cloud Logging with structured JSON format
- Error Tracking: Cloud Logging error reporting with alert policies
- Data Quality Monitoring: Custom metrics based on BigQuery validation queries

**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Monitoring: Google Cloud Logging (Latest) - Built-in monitoring, no extra tools needed
- Backend Language: Python 3.11+ for monitoring script implementation
- Scheduling: Google Cloud Scheduler for automated monitoring checks
- Secret Management: Google Secret Manager for notification credentials

**Project Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Monitoring code location: `src/shared/logging_setup.py` (existing, needs enhancement)
- Health check location: `src/orchestration/health_check.py` (existing, needs monitoring integration)
- Main orchestrator: `src/orchestration/daily_job.py` (needs monitoring instrumentation)
- Configuration: `src/shared/config.py` (needs monitoring config)

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Error Handling: All external API calls must use try-catch with exponential backoff retry logic
- Logging Format: All logs must use structured JSON format with request_id for traceability
- Configuration Access: Access secrets only through config.get_secret(), never os.environ directly
- Data Validation: Schema validation required before BigQuery operations

**Critical NFR Requirements**:
- NFR1: System shall maintain 99.5% uptime for daily data ingestion jobs with automatic retry mechanisms
- NFR6: All data transformations shall be logged with structured JSON format for debugging and monitoring
- NFR8: System shall provide health check endpoints for monitoring job success/failure status
- FR8: System shall provide email alerts when monthly costs increase by >20% compared to previous month
- FR12: System shall provide production health monitoring through Cloud Run health checks and comprehensive logging

### Alert Policy Configuration
```yaml
# Required Alert Policies [Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md]
alerts:
  - name: "Daily Job Failure"
    condition: "Pipeline execution fails"
    notification: "Email to engineering team"
  - name: "Data Quality Issue"
    condition: "Validation errors > 5%"
    notification: "Email to data team + finance team"
  - name: "Cost Anomaly"
    condition: "Daily costs > 120% of 7-day average"
    notification: "Email to finance team"
  - name: "API Rate Limit"
    condition: "429 errors > 10 in 1 hour"
    notification: "Slack engineering channel"
```

### Key Metrics Targets
**Pipeline Metrics**: Daily job success rate (target: >99%), API response times (target: <30 seconds per call), BigQuery load times (target: <2 minutes total), Data freshness (alert if >25 hours old)

**Business Metrics**: Records processed per day, Cost data accuracy (variance from expected ranges), User attribution completeness (target: >95%), Cross-platform data consistency

**Error Metrics**: API failure rate by platform, Data validation failure rate, Retry attempt frequency, Manual intervention requirements

### Testing

**Test File Locations** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_monitoring.py` (create new)
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_monitoring_integration.py` (create new)

**Testing Framework**: pytest 7.4+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Testing Requirements**:
- Unit tests for custom metrics collection functions with mocked Cloud Monitoring API
- Integration tests for actual Cloud Monitoring API calls using test workspace
- Mock tests for alert policy triggers and notification delivery
- Structured logging format validation tests
- Error categorization logic verification tests

**Test Data Location**: `tests/fixtures/` for sample monitoring events and alert scenarios

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 4.1 (Production Monitoring & Alerting Infrastructure) provides the monitoring foundation. This story builds on that monitoring to implement data-specific quality validation that integrates with the alert policies created in 4.1.

### Technical Architecture References

**Data Quality Requirements** [Source: prd.md#FR7]:
- FR7: The system shall implement automated data validation checks to ensure accuracy against vendor invoices
- System Administration Panel: Data quality monitoring and manual controls (admin-only)

**Existing Validation Infrastructure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Validation module: `src/processing/validator.py` (existing, needs enhancement)
- BigQuery operations: `src/storage/bigquery_client.py` (for quality metrics storage)
- Schema manager: `src/storage/schema_manager.py` (for schema drift detection)

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Data Validation: Never insert data to BigQuery without schema validation - use validate_schema() before all inserts
- Error Handling: All external API calls must use try-catch with exponential backoff retry logic
- Logging Format: All logs must use structured JSON format with request_id for traceability
- Batch Processing: Use 1000-record batches for BigQuery inserts to optimize performance

**Testing Requirements** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Data quality validation checks with schema drift detection
- Integration tests with BigQuery sandbox for data pipeline validation
- Unit tests for validation logic with mocked data scenarios

**Data Quality Architecture** [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]:
- Data Lake + Data Warehouse: Raw ingestion with curated analytics layers in BigQuery - Enables data quality validation while supporting both operational and analytical queries
- API Gateway Pattern: Centralized error handling and retry logic across all external APIs - Ensures consistent data quality and reliability across multiple data sources

### Data Quality Metrics Targets

**Completeness Metrics**:
- User attribution completeness: >95% target
- API key mapping coverage: 100% for active keys
- Cost data completeness: >98% for billing reconciliation

**Accuracy Metrics**:
- Vendor invoice variance: <5% acceptable threshold
- Schema validation pass rate: >99% target
- Data type validation: 100% compliance required

**Freshness Metrics**:
- Data staleness alert: >25 hours old
- Processing lag monitoring: <2 hours from 6 AM PT trigger
- Real-time quality dashboard updates

### Validation Rules Framework

**Schema Validation Rules**:
- Required fields presence validation
- Data type compliance checking (STRING, INTEGER, FLOAT, DATE, BOOLEAN)
- Format validation for email addresses and timestamps
- Enum value validation for platform and model fields

**Business Logic Validation**:
- Cost values must be non-negative
- Usage metrics must be within reasonable ranges
- Date ranges must be sequential and logical
- API key mappings must exist for cost attribution

**Data Integrity Checks**:
- Referential integrity between fact and dimension tables
- Duplicate record detection across platforms
- Cross-platform data consistency validation
- Historical data comparison for anomaly detection

### Quality Alert Integration

**Alert Policy Integration** [Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md]:
```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "Data Quality Issue"
    condition: "Validation errors > 5%"
    notification: "Email to data team + finance team"
```

**Quality Threshold Configuration**:
- Critical: >10% validation failure rate (immediate escalation)
- Warning: 5-10% validation failure rate (team notification)
- Info: <5% validation failure rate (dashboard logging only)

### Testing

**Test File Locations** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_validator.py` (enhance existing)
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_data_quality.py` (create new)
- Test fixtures: `tests/fixtures/invalid_data_samples.json` (create new)

**Testing Framework**: pytest 7.4+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Testing Requirements**:
- Validation rule testing with edge cases and boundary conditions
- Schema drift simulation with mock API responses
- Invoice reconciliation algorithm testing with known variance scenarios
- Quality metrics calculation verification with sample datasets
- Alert trigger testing with simulated quality threshold breaches
- Performance testing for validation processing overhead

**Data Quality Test Scenarios**:
- Valid data passing all validation rules
- Invalid schema responses triggering drift detection
- Cost variance scenarios requiring reconciliation alerts
- Missing data scenarios testing completeness metrics
- Performance testing with large dataset validation

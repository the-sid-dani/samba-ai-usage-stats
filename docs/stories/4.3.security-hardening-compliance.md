## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Security Administrator,

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Stories 4.1 (Monitoring) and 4.2 (Data Quality) provide the monitoring and logging infrastructure. This story builds on that foundation to implement security-specific controls and compliance features that integrate with the existing monitoring framework.

### Security Architecture References

**Security Requirements** [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]:
- **API Security**: Credential storage in Google Secret Manager with audit logging, service accounts with least privilege, Cloud Run with no public access
- **BigQuery Security**: Project-level IAM with role-based permissions, audit logging via Cloud Audit Logs, data classification as internal business data
- **Network Security**: Cloud Run with no public access, scheduler-triggered only, TLS 1.2+ in transit, Google-managed keys at rest

**NFR Requirements**:
- **NFR3**: All API keys and credentials shall be stored securely in Google Secret Manager with audit logging enabled
- **NFR7**: BigQuery dataset shall use US region with Google-managed encryption for data at rest

**Compliance Dashboard** [Source: prd.md#UI Design Goals]:
- **Compliance & Security View**: Access auditing and API key management (security-only)
- Role-based navigation with security-team specific access and controls

### Configuration Management

**Current Config Pattern** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- **Configuration Access**: Access secrets only through config.get_secret(), never os.environ directly
- **Secret Management**: Google Secret Manager for API keys with quarterly rotation

**Config Module Enhancement** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Location: `src/shared/config.py` (existing, needs Secret Manager integration)
- Pattern: Centralized configuration management with audit logging

### IAM Architecture Design

**Service Account Strategy**:
- **Ingestion Service Account**: Limited to Secret Manager access and BigQuery write permissions
- **Processing Service Account**: BigQuery read/write with data transformation permissions
- **Monitoring Service Account**: Cloud Monitoring write and audit log read permissions
- **Rotation Service Account**: Secret Manager admin for key rotation operations

**Permission Boundaries**:
- BigQuery: `roles/bigquery.dataEditor` on dataset (not `roles/bigquery.admin`)
- Secret Manager: `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` on specific secrets
- Cloud Run: `roles/run.invoker` for scheduled execution only
- Cloud Logging: `roles/logging.logWriter` for audit trail creation

### Audit Logging Framework

**Security Event Categories**:
- **Authentication Events**: Service account token usage, API key access
- **Authorization Events**: Permission grants, role assignments, access denials
- **Data Events**: BigQuery operations, schema modifications, data exports
- **Administrative Events**: Secret rotation, IAM changes, configuration updates

**Audit Log Structure**:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-27T07:00:00Z",
  "request_id": "req_abc123",
  "event_type": "secret_access",
  "service_account": "ai-usage-ingestion@ai-workflows-459123.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "resource": "projects/ai-workflows-459123/secrets/anthropic-api-key",
  "action": "access",
  "result": "success",
  "user_agent": "cloud-run-service/1.0"
}
```

### API Key Rotation Implementation

**Quarterly Rotation Schedule**:
- **Q1 Rotation**: January 15th (after holiday period)
- **Q2 Rotation**: April 15th (mid-quarter)
- **Q3 Rotation**: July 15th (mid-summer)
- **Q4 Rotation**: October 15th (before holiday season)

**Rotation Workflow**:
1. Generate new API keys via vendor portals
2. Store new keys in Secret Manager with version tags
3. Update application configuration to use new keys
4. Validate functionality with new keys
5. Revoke old keys after successful validation
6. Notify stakeholders of completion

**Rollback Procedures**:
- Secret Manager version rollback capability
- Emergency contact procedures for vendor support
- Service restore procedures using previous key versions

### Testing

**Security Testing Requirements** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Unit tests for Secret Manager integration with mock API responses
- IAM permission boundary testing with service account simulation
- Audit logging verification with structured log validation
- API key rotation testing with mock vendor interactions
- Security penetration testing with unauthorized access attempts

**Test File Locations**:
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_security.py` (create new)
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_security_integration.py` (create new)
- Security fixtures: `tests/fixtures/security_test_data.json` (create new)

**Testing Framework**: pytest 7.4+ with security-specific test cases

### Compliance Requirements

**Data Retention and Classification**:
- Audit logs: 7-year retention for compliance
- Security events: Real-time monitoring with 2-year historical analysis
- Access logs: Full audit trail for investigative purposes

**Regulatory Considerations**:
- Internal business data classification (no PII handling required)
- Financial data handling for cost and usage analytics
- Audit trail completeness for financial reporting compliance

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Stories 4.1 (Monitoring), 4.2 (Data Quality), and 4.3 (Security) provide the monitoring, validation, and security infrastructure. This story builds on those foundations to implement the reliability and recovery layer that ensures system resilience and automated failure recovery.

### Technical Architecture References

**Reliability Requirements**:
- **NFR1**: The system shall maintain 99.5% uptime for daily data ingestion jobs with automatic retry mechanisms
- **NFR8**: The system shall provide health check endpoints for monitoring job success/failure status
- **NFR4**: The system shall implement exponential backoff for API rate limit handling with maximum 3 retry attempts

**Existing Health Infrastructure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Health check module: `src/orchestration/health_check.py` (existing, needs enhancement)
- Main orchestrator: `src/orchestration/daily_job.py` (needs recovery integration)
- Error handling: Already implements exponential backoff retry logic

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- **Error Handling**: All external API calls must use try-catch with exponential backoff retry logic
- **Logging Format**: All logs must use structured JSON format with request_id for traceability

### Circuit Breaker Implementation

**Circuit Breaker States**:
- **CLOSED**: Normal operation, requests pass through
- **OPEN**: Circuit tripped, requests fail fast
- **HALF_OPEN**: Testing recovery, limited requests allowed

**Circuit Breaker Configuration**:
```python
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_CONFIG = {
    "failure_threshold": 5,      # Failures to trigger OPEN state
    "recovery_timeout": 60,      # Seconds before HALF_OPEN attempt
    "success_threshold": 3,      # Successes to return to CLOSED
    "timeout": 30               # Request timeout in seconds
}
```

**API-Specific Circuit Breakers**:
- **Anthropic API**: 5 failures = 60 second timeout
- **Cursor API**: 5 failures = 60 second timeout
- **Google Sheets API**: 3 failures = 30 second timeout (more tolerant)
- **BigQuery**: 10 failures = 120 second timeout (critical path)

### Enhanced Retry Logic

**Current Retry Implementation** [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]:
- Exponential backoff: 2^retry_count seconds
- Maximum 3 retry attempts
- Implements try-catch with error logging

**Enhancements Required**:
- **Jitter Addition**: Random delay (±25%) to prevent synchronized retries
- **Failure Classification**: Distinguish transient (retry) vs permanent (fail) errors
- **Retry Budget**: Limit total retry time to prevent indefinite delays
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Store permanently failed requests for manual investigation

**Intelligent Failure Classification**:
```python
TRANSIENT_ERRORS = [
    "rate_limit_exceeded",     # HTTP 429
    "service_unavailable",     # HTTP 503
    "timeout",                 # Request timeout
    "connection_error"         # Network issues
]

PERMANENT_ERRORS = [
    "authentication_failed",   # HTTP 401
    "forbidden",              # HTTP 403
    "not_found",              # HTTP 404
    "bad_request"             # HTTP 400
]
```

### Health Check Architecture

**Component Health Checks**:
- **BigQuery Health**: Connection test + query execution validation
- **Secret Manager Health**: Credential access test + rotation status
- **External APIs Health**: Endpoint availability + authentication validation
- **System Resources Health**: Memory usage + processing capacity

**Health Check Response Format**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy|degraded|unhealthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-27T07:00:00Z",
  "components": {
    "bigquery": {"status": "healthy", "latency_ms": 45},
    "anthropic_api": {"status": "degraded", "circuit_state": "half_open"},
    "cursor_api": {"status": "healthy", "last_success": "2025-09-27T06:58:00Z"},
    "secret_manager": {"status": "healthy", "secrets_accessible": 4}
  },
  "overall_health_score": 85
}
```

### Automated Recovery Workflows

**Recovery Scenarios**:
1. **API Outage Recovery**: Circuit breaker activation → Graceful degradation → Service restoration
2. **Pipeline Failure Recovery**: Checkpoint detection → Data validation → Incremental restart
3. **Service Restart Recovery**: Health check failure → Container restart → Dependency validation
4. **Data Corruption Recovery**: Backup detection → Point-in-time restore → Pipeline resume

**Recovery Orchestration Flow**:
1. **Failure Detection**: Health check or monitoring alert triggers
2. **Impact Assessment**: Determine scope and severity of failure
3. **Recovery Strategy Selection**: Choose appropriate recovery workflow
4. **Recovery Execution**: Automated procedures with progress tracking
5. **Validation**: Health checks confirm successful recovery
6. **Notification**: Stakeholder communication and incident logging

### Disaster Recovery Architecture

**Backup Strategy** [Source: operations/backup-recovery.md]:
- **BigQuery**: Point-in-time recovery with 7-day retention
- **Secret Manager**: Version history with rollback capability
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform state management with version control
- **Configuration**: GitOps deployment with rollback procedures

**Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)**:
- **Service Restoration**: 15 minutes (infrastructure rebuild)
- **Data Recovery**: 30 minutes (BigQuery point-in-time restore)
- **Full System Recovery**: 1 hour (complete service reconstruction)

**Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)**:
- **Data Loss Tolerance**: 24 hours (daily batch processing acceptable)
- **Configuration Loss**: 0 (version controlled in git)
- **Monitoring History**: 7 days (archived in Cloud Logging)

### Testing

**Test File Locations** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_health_check.py` (enhance existing)
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_recovery_systems.py` (create new)
- Chaos tests: `tests/chaos/test_failure_scenarios.py` (create new)

**Testing Framework**: pytest 7.4+ with chaos engineering simulation

**Recovery Testing Requirements**:
- **Health Check Testing**: All component health validations with mock failures
- **Circuit Breaker Testing**: State transition validation with simulated API failures
- **Retry Logic Testing**: Exponential backoff with jitter validation
- **Recovery Workflow Testing**: End-to-end recovery procedures with real failure injection
- **Disaster Recovery Testing**: Full system reconstruction from backup procedures

**Chaos Engineering Test Scenarios**:
- API service failures during data ingestion
- BigQuery temporary unavailability
- Secret Manager access failures
- Network connectivity issues
- Cloud Run container crashes
- Multiple simultaneous component failures

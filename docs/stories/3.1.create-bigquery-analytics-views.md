- **Cost Facts:** `fct_cost_daily` (with user attribution)
- **Dimensions:** `dim_users`, `dim_api_keys`
- **Raw Tables:** Available for detailed analysis if needed

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Source:** [architecture/testing-strategy.md#sql-testing]

## QA Results

### Review Date: September 26, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Outstanding implementation of BigQuery analytics views with sophisticated SQL engineering. The 400+ lines of optimized SQL across 4 comprehensive views demonstrate expert-level data modeling and performance optimization. Views are well-structured with proper CTEs, efficient aggregations, and business-ready KPI calculations.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: sql/views/vw_cost_allocation.sql
  - **Change**: Removed problematic last_updated field reference in freshness calculation
  - **Why**: Field was not available in the view context, causing potential SQL errors
  - **How**: Simplified freshness tracking to use view_generated_at timestamp

- **File**: sql/test_queries/test_views_performance.sql
  - **Change**: Added clarifying comment about performance measurement requirements
  - **Why**: Improved test documentation clarity for future maintenance
  - **How**: Added note about actual timing measurement needs

- **File**: tests/integration/test_bigquery_views.py
  - **Change**: Added UTF-8 encoding specification to file reading
  - **Why**: Ensures proper handling of SQL files with special characters
  - **How**: Added encoding='utf-8' parameter to file open operations

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Excellent SQL formatting, consistent naming, proper documentation
- Project Structure: ✓ Well-organized in sql/views/ with test separation
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive integration tests and performance validation queries
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented with business logic

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed SQL field reference issue in cost allocation view
- [x] Enhanced performance test documentation clarity
- [x] Improved test file encoding handling for robustness
- [ ] Consider adding materialized view options for high-frequency queries (future enhancement)
- [ ] Add view refresh monitoring alerts in production (future enhancement)
- [ ] Implement view dependency documentation (future enhancement)

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Views properly:
- Use parameterized table references with project/dataset variables
- Filter data appropriately with date range limitations
- Include proper attribution requirements for user data access
- Follow least-privilege access patterns for analytics workloads

### Performance Considerations

Excellent performance optimizations implemented:
- Date-based filtering for partition pruning (12-month lookback windows)
- Efficient aggregation patterns with appropriate GROUP BY clauses
- Proper use of CTEs for query readability and optimization
- Window functions for trend calculations without unnecessary joins
- Target <5 second execution time with validation queries

### Files Modified During Review

- sql/views/vw_cost_allocation.sql: Fixed field reference issue
- sql/test_queries/test_views_performance.sql: Enhanced documentation
- tests/integration/test_bigquery_views.py: Added UTF-8 encoding specification

## Dev Notes

### BigQuery Table Structure
**Source:** SQL definitions in sql/tables/ directory
- **Raw Tables:** Store unprocessed API responses
- **Dimension Tables:** User and API key reference data
- **Fact Tables:** Normalized usage and cost data with partitioning
- **Analytics Views:** Aggregated KPI calculations for dashboards

### Deployment Process
**Template Variable Substitution:**
- Replace ${project_id} with actual GCP project ID
- Replace ${dataset} with ai_usage_analytics dataset name
- Execute SQL using bq command-line tool or BigQuery console

**Performance Configuration:**
- Date-based partitioning on usage_date and cost_date columns
- Clustering on platform and user_email for common filter patterns
- 2+ year retention for historical analysis

### Validation Queries
**Schema Verification:**
```sql
-- Verify table creation
SELECT table_name, table_type, creation_time
FROM `project.ai_usage_analytics.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`
ORDER BY creation_time DESC;

-- Test view functionality
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `project.ai_usage_analytics.vw_monthly_finance` LIMIT 1;
```

## Testing
- All tables must be created without schema errors
- All views must execute successfully
- Query performance must meet <5 second target
- Template variable substitution must be correct

### Key Features Implemented

#### Deployment Script (`deploy_bigquery_schema.sh`)
- **Prerequisites validation**: gcloud auth, project access, CLI tools
- **Dataset management**: Automatic creation with proper location/description
- **Template substitution**: Replaces `${project_id}` and `${dataset}` variables

### Production Deployment Instructions

#### Prerequisites
```bash
# Authenticate with Google Cloud
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Verify BigQuery access
bq ls
```

#### Execute Deployment
```bash
# Deploy schema to production
./scripts/deploy_bigquery_schema.sh your-project-id ai_usage_analytics

# Validate deployment
./scripts/validate_bigquery_deployment.sh your-project-id ai_usage_analytics
```

- **Views Created:** 4+ analytics views
- **Performance:** < 5 second query targets
- **Governance:** Retention policies applied
- **Validation:** All tests passing

### Schema Components Deployed

#### Tables (7)

2. `raw_anthropic_usage` - Partitioned by ingest_date, clustered by user_email/usage_date
3. `raw_anthropic_cost` - Partitioned by ingest_date, clustered by user_email/cost_date
4. `dim_users` - User reference data
5. `dim_api_keys` - API key metadata
6. `fct_usage_daily` - Daily usage aggregations, partitioned by usage_date
7. `fct_cost_daily` - Daily cost aggregations, partitioned by cost_date

## QA Results

### Review Date: September 27, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**EXCELLENT** - Comprehensive BigQuery schema implementation with sophisticated analytics views, proper performance optimization, and automated deployment/validation procedures. Implementation demonstrates enterprise-grade data warehouse design patterns with advanced SQL techniques.

### Refactoring Performed

**CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED**: Fixed schema template inconsistency that would have caused deployment failures.

- **File**: All table SQL files (sql/tables/*.sql)
  - **Change**: Replaced hardcoded `ai_usage.` dataset references with `${project_id}.${dataset}.` template variables
  - **Why**: Table definitions were inconsistent with view templates, causing deployment script to rely on regex workarounds
  - **How**: Standardized all schema references to use template substitution for proper multi-environment deployment

- **File**: scripts/deploy_bigquery_schema.sh
  - **Change**: Removed unnecessary regex workaround from template substitution function
  - **Why**: No longer needed after fixing source schema files, cleaner deployment process
  - **How**: Simplified template substitution to standard project_id/dataset variable replacement

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ SQL follows BigQuery best practices with proper partitioning, clustering, and optimization
- Project Structure: ✓ Well-organized sql/ directory with logical separation of tables, views, and utilities
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive validation framework with performance testing and schema verification
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented with automation and validation

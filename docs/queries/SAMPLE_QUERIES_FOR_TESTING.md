  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `ai-workflows-459123.ai_usage_analytics.raw_claude_ai_audit_events`
   WHERE event_date >= '2025-09-27' AND actor_email LIKE '%samba.tv'
   AND event_type = 'conversation_created') as claude_ai_conversations,

  -- Cross-platform overlap
  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_email) FROM (
    SELECT email as user_email FROM `ai-workflows-459123.ai_usage_analytics.raw_cursor_usage`
    WHERE ingest_date >= '2025-09-27' AND email LIKE '%samba.tv'
    INTERSECT DISTINCT
    SELECT actor_email as user_email FROM `ai-workflows-459123.ai_usage_analytics.raw_claude_ai_audit_events`

  )) as multi_platform_users
```

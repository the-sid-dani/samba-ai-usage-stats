# Dashboard Queries for AI Usage Analytics

## Core Analytics Queries for Dashboard Building

These queries power the main dashboard charts and KPIs for finance team usage analytics.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Dashboard Implementation Notes**

### **Query Usage:**
- **Queries 1-3**: Main dashboard charts
- **Query 4**: User management and adoption tracking
- **Query 5**: Department cost allocation
- **Query 6**: Usage pattern analysis
- **Query 7**: Executive KPI summary

### **Performance:**
- All queries use partition filters (`ingest_date`) for optimal performance
- Target <5 second execution (currently achieving <2 seconds)
- Efficient aggregation reduces data scanning

### **Data Freshness:**
- Updated daily via cron pipeline
- Real-time access to usage patterns
- Historical trending available

**These queries provide complete visibility into AI tool usage costs and productivity across the samba.tv engineering organization.**

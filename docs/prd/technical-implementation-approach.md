# Technical Implementation Approach

## Phase 1: Prove Architecture
- Start with Cursor integration only
- Validate entire pipeline: API → BigQuery → Looker
- Implement comprehensive error handling early
- **Success Criteria:** End-to-end data flow working reliably

## Phase 2: Add Complexity
- Integrate Anthropic APIs with extensive testing
- Implement Google Sheets mapping with validation
- Add basic monitoring and alerting
- **Success Criteria:** Multi-platform cost attribution working

## Phase 3: Polish & Harden
- Build advanced Metabase dashboards
- Implement automated data quality checks
- Add production monitoring and recovery
- **Success Criteria:** Finance team can use system independently

## Phase 4: Infrastructure Execution
- Execute Terraform infrastructure provisioning
- Deploy BigQuery tables and views to production
- Configure Secret Manager with API keys
- Set up IAM roles and service accounts
- **Success Criteria:** GCP infrastructure fully provisioned and accessible

## Phase 5: Production Deployment & Integration
- Build and deploy Docker container to Cloud Run
- Configure Cloud Scheduler for daily automation
- Execute end-to-end integration testing with real APIs
- Validate data pipeline with production data
- **Success Criteria:** System running autonomously in production with real data

## Contingency Plans
- **API Integration Issues:** Fall back to manual data upload initially
- **Performance Problems:** Implement caching and query optimization
- **Data Quality Issues:** Add manual validation checkpoints
- **User Adoption Problems:** Provide training and support documentation

# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- **Financial Visibility:** Unified dashboard providing 100% AI spending visibility across Claude.ai, Claude Code, Claude API, and Cursor platforms
- **Cost Optimization:** Enable identification of 15-20% cost savings opportunities within 1 quarter through data-driven insights
- **Operational Efficiency:** Reduce manual reporting effort by 80% through automated daily data ingestion and dashboard generation
- **ROI Tracking:** Provide clear metrics on AI tool usage efficiency and productivity gains across team members
- **Budget Planning:** Support quarterly budget forecasting with accurate historical usage and cost trends

## Background Context

Our organization currently spends $7k+ monthly across 4 different AI platforms (Claude.ai, Claude Code, Claude API, and Cursor) with 30-40 API keys distributed among ~15 team members. The finance team (Jaya) lacks consolidated visibility into this spending, resulting in manual effort for quarterly reviews and missed optimization opportunities.

This PRD addresses the critical need for a unified analytics dashboard that automates data collection from vendor APIs, stores information in a BigQuery data warehouse, and presents finance-focused KPIs through Looker dashboards. The solution will provide single source of truth for AI usage patterns, cost allocation by user/team, and ROI metrics essential for strategic decision-making.

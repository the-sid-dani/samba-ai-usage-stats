# Next Steps

## Architect Handoff
Use this PRD to create technical architecture documentation covering:
- BigQuery schema design with partitioning strategy
- ETL pipeline architecture for each data source
- Metabase deployment specification
- API integration patterns and error handling

Reference preserved documentation:
- `/docs/api-reference/cursor-api-specs.md`
- `/docs/api-reference/metabase-architecture.md`

## Developer Handoff
Break down epics into user stories focusing on:
- Table creation and schema implementation
- API client development with testing
- Dashboard creation with Metabase API
- Automation and monitoring setup

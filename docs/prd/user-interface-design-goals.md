# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Clean, finance-focused dashboard emphasizing cost visibility and trend analysis. Primary users are finance professionals who need quick access to spending summaries, cost allocation by user/team, and month-over-month comparisons. Interface should minimize cognitive load while providing drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Role-based Navigation:** Different menu structures for Finance vs Engineering vs Admin users
- **Contextual Help:** Embedded tooltips and metric definitions for non-technical finance users
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Summary cards that expand to detailed breakdowns on click
- **Cross-Dashboard Linking:** Ability to jump from cost anomaly to productivity details for root cause analysis

## Core Screens and Views
1. **Finance Executive Dashboard** - High-level spend summary with budget variance alerts
2. **Cost Allocation Workbench** - Detailed user/team/project cost breakdowns with export tools
3. **Engineering Productivity Analytics** - Developer efficiency metrics and team comparisons
4. **Platform ROI Analysis** - Cost-per-productivity calculations across all AI tools
5. **System Administration Panel** - Data quality monitoring and manual controls (admin-only)
6. **Compliance & Security View** - Access auditing and API key management (security-only)

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Full dashboard navigation without mouse for accessibility compliance
- **Screen Reader Support:** Proper ARIA labels for all charts and data tables
- **Color Blind Friendly:** Blue/orange color scheme instead of red/green for status indicators
- **High Contrast Mode:** Optional high contrast theme for visually impaired users

## Branding
Corporate-standard Metabase styling with clear, professional aesthetic focused on data readability rather than visual flourishes, utilizing Metabase theming capabilities for consistent branding.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary usage on desktop/laptop for detailed analysis, with responsive design supporting tablet access for executive summary views.

# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**API Security:**
- **Credential Storage:** All API keys stored in Google Secret Manager with audit logging
- **Access Control:** Service accounts with principle of least privilege
- **Network Security:** Cloud Run with no public access, scheduler-triggered only
- **Data Encryption:** TLS 1.2+ in transit, Google-managed keys at rest

**BigQuery Security:**
- **Dataset Access:** Project-level IAM with role-based permissions
- **Row-Level Security:** Not required for this use case (internal analytics)
- **Audit Logging:** All queries logged via Cloud Audit Logs
- **Data Classification:** Internal business data, no PII handling required

## Performance Optimization

**Data Pipeline Performance:**
- **Parallel Processing:** Concurrent API calls reduce total execution time from ~15 minutes to ~5 minutes
- **Batch Size Optimization:** 1000-record batches for BigQuery streaming inserts
- **Query Optimization:** Partitioned tables reduce scan costs by 80-90%
- **Caching Strategy:** No caching required for daily batch processing

**BigQuery Performance:**
- **Partition Strategy:** Date partitioning enables efficient time-range queries
- **Clustering:** User email and platform clustering optimizes dashboard queries
- **Materialized Views:** Consider for frequently accessed aggregations if query costs increase
- **Slot Management:** Use on-demand pricing, monitor for potential reservation needs

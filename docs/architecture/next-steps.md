# Next Steps

## Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Prove Architecture**
- Start with Cursor integration only
- Validate entire pipeline: API → BigQuery → Looker
- Implement comprehensive error handling early
- **Success Criteria:** End-to-end data flow working reliably

**Phase 2: Add Complexity**
- Integrate Anthropic APIs with extensive testing
- Implement Google Sheets mapping with validation
- Add basic monitoring and alerting
- **Success Criteria:** Multi-platform cost attribution working

**Phase 3: Polish & Harden**
- Build advanced Looker dashboards
- Implement automated data quality checks
- Add production monitoring and recovery
- **Success Criteria:** Finance team can use system independently

## Contingency Plans
- **API Integration Issues:** Fall back to manual data upload initially
- **Performance Problems:** Implement caching and query optimization
- **Data Quality Issues:** Add manual validation checkpoints
- **User Adoption Problems:** Provide training and support documentation

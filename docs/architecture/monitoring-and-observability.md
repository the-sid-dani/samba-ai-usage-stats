# Monitoring and Observability

## Monitoring Stack
- **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Google Cloud Monitoring (native GCP integration)
- **Application Logging:** Google Cloud Logging with structured JSON format
- **Error Tracking:** Cloud Logging error reporting with alert policies
- **Data Quality Monitoring:** Custom metrics based on BigQuery validation queries

## Key Metrics

**Pipeline Metrics:**
- Daily job success rate (target: >99%)
- API response times (target: <30 seconds per call)
- BigQuery load times (target: <2 minutes total)
- Data freshness (alert if >25 hours old)

**Business Metrics:**
- Records processed per day
- Cost data accuracy (variance from expected ranges)
- User attribution completeness (target: >95%)
- Cross-platform data consistency

**Error Metrics:**
- API failure rate by platform
- Data validation failure rate
- Retry attempt frequency
- Manual intervention requirements

## Alerting Strategy
```yaml
# Cloud Monitoring Alert Policies
alerts:
  - name: "Daily Job Failure"
    condition: "Pipeline execution fails"
    notification: "Email to engineering team"

  - name: "Data Quality Issue"
    condition: "Validation errors > 5%"
    notification: "Email to data team + finance team"

  - name: "Cost Anomaly"
    condition: "Daily costs > 120% of 7-day average"
    notification: "Email to finance team"

  - name: "API Rate Limit"
    condition: "429 errors > 10 in 1 hour"
    notification: "Slack engineering channel"
```
